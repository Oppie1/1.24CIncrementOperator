First Copy and paste this code prior to moving onto main code

//Use three variables "a, b and answer to show how increament operator works
a++ vs ++a, use "answer as the  placeholder for the function"

Then use "tuna = 20" To increment tuna by one.

It should look like this when printed out on screen when complete
50
60
20
21

int a = 5, b = 10, answer = 0;
	answer = ++a * b; // add 1 to a here before hand
	printf("Answer: %d \n", answer);

	a = 5, b = 10, answer = 0;
	answer = a++ * b;  // add one to a after equation
	printf("Answer: %d \n", answer);

	int tuna = 20;

		printf("%d\n", tuna);
		tuna++;
		printf("%d\n", tuna);

		return 0;



/* Write code that increments int a, b variale from 5 - 10 using (a++)
print out variable answer.  after this a++ operation and see diference.
Then print out answer for that as well*/
