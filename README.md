//Use three variables "a, b and answer to show how increament operator works
a++ vs ++a, use "answer" as the  placeholder for the function"

/* Write code that increments int a, b variale from 5 - 10 using (a++)
print out variable answer.  After this a++ operation and see diference.
Then print out answer for that as well*/

Then use "tuna = 20" To increment tuna by one.

It should look like this when printed out on screen when complete
50
60
20
21


/* Write code that increments int a, b variale from 5 - 10 using (a++)
